We study the exchange economies of Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) in which agents must use a 
commodity or fiat money as a medium of exchange if trade is to occur. Our agents are artificially 
intelligent and are modeled as using classifier systems to make decisions. In the assignment of 
credit within the classifier systems, we introduce some innovations designed to study sequential 
decision problems in a multi-agent environment. For most economies that we have simulated, 
trading and consumption patterns converge to a stationary Nash equilibrium even if agents start 
with random rules. In economies with multiple equilibria, the only equilibrium that emerges in our 
simulations is the one in which goods with low storage costs play the role of medium of exchange 
(i.e., the ‘fundamental equilibrium’ of Riyotaki and Wright). 
1. Introduction 
Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) studied how three classes of rational agents 
would interact within a Nash-Markov 
equilibrium in a world of repeated 
‘Wicksell triangles’. This paper studies how a collection of artificially intelli- 
gent agents would learn to coordinate their activities if they were thrust into 
the economic environment described by Kiyotaki and Wright. Our agents’

behavior 
is determined 
by Holland 
(1975) 
classifier 
systems.’ 
Thus, 
while 
Kiyotaki 
and 
Wright 
studied 
stationary 
equilibria 
in which 
beliefs 
about 
‘media 
of exchange’ 
are consistent 
with trading 
patterns, 
we study economies 
in which particular 
commodities 
emerge as media of exchange. 
We also study 
an economy 
(Economy 
C) in which a good from which no agent derives utility 
emerges 
as fiat money. 
We want 
to learn 
whether 
our artificially 
intelligent 
agents can learn to play a Markovian 
Nash equilibrium 
of the Kiyotaki-Wright 
model. 
When 
there are multiple 
Nash equilibria 
(e.g., the ‘fundamental’ 
and 
‘speculative’ 
equilibria 
of Kiyotaki 
and Wright), 
we want to know whether 
the 
system might converge 
to some but not others of these equilibria. 
In addition, 
if classifier 
systems 
do converge 
to Nash-Markov 
equilibria, 
they might 
be 
used to compute 
equilibria 
in other economies 
for which it is difficult to obtain 
analytic 
solutions. 
To this 
end, 
we also 
study 
enlarged 
versions 
of the 
Kiyotaki-Wright 
model. 
A clussiJier system is a collection 
of potential 
decision 
rules, together 
with an 
accounting 
system 
for selecting 
which rules to use. The accounting 
system 
credits 
rules generating 
good outcomes 
and debits 
rules generating 
bad out- 
comes. The system is designed 
to select a ‘co-adaptive’ 
set of rules that work 
well over the range 
of situations 
that an agent 
typically 
encounters. 
In a 
multiple-agent 
environment 
like Kiyotaki 
and Wright’s, 
the range of situations 
encountered 
by one agent depends 
on the actions 
taken by other agents. This 
means 
that the collections 
of rules used by the collection 
agents must co-adapt 
jointly. 
We study two sorts of classifier 
systems, with the distinction 
between 
them 
being 
induced 
by the fact that for many 
problems 
enumerating 
all possible 
rules would require 
a very long list. The first kind of classifier 
system is one in 
which a complete 
enumeration 
of all possible 
rules is carried along. For many 
problems, 
it is not feasible 
to use a complete 
enumeration 
classifier 
system 
because 
the state and action spaces are so large that the set of all possible 
rules 
is much 
too big. For us, a complete 
enumeration 
is tractable 
because 
the 
Kiyotaki-Wright 
model has low-dimensional 
state and action 
spaces. 
The second 
kind of classifier system is designed 
for situations 
in which it is 
not efficient 
to carry along a complete 
enumeration 
of decision 
rules. In this 
case, a modified 
version of the genetic algorithm 
of Holland 
is used as a device 
‘The way in which we model agents as searching 
for rewarding 
decision 
rules attributes 
much 
less knowledge 
and rationality 
to them than is typical in the literature 
on least-squares 
learning 
in 
the context 
of linear 
rational-expectations 
models 
[see Bray 
(1982), 
Bray 
and 
Savin 
(1986). 
Fourgeaud, 
Gourieroux, 
and Pradel (1986). and Marcet 
and Sargent 
(1989)]. In the least-squares 
learning 
literature, 
agents 
are posited 
to be almost 
fully rational 
and knowledgeable 
about 
the 
system they operate 
within, lacking knowledge 
only about particular 
parameters 
in laws of motion 
of a set of variables 
exogenous 
to their own decisions, 
which 
they learn 
about 
through 
the 
recursive 
application 
of least squares. 
But given their estimates, 
agents 
are supposed 
to compute 
optimal 
decision 
rules by using dynamic 
programming 
or the calculus 
of variations.

for periodically 
eliminating some rules and injecting new rules into the 
population of rules to be operated on by the accounting system. The genetic- 
algorithm version of the classifier models learning in the face of unforeseen 
contingencies. When an unprecedented state arises which is not covered by the 
existing set of rules, the system contains a procedure for manufacturing 
and 
experimenting with new rules that apply in the new situation. Even though it is 
feasible for us to work with a complete enumeration of rules, we also study the 
genetic-algorithm 
version of the classifier.2 
In this paper, we set up classifier systems for the Kiyotaki-Wright 
environ- 
ment and simulate them on a computer. We also formulate definitions of 
equilibrium 
and stability for classifier systems, and pose some convergence 
questions. Although we suggest possible convergence theorems, we prove no 
theorems in this paper. Section 2 describes the Kiyotaki-Wright 
environment. 
Section 3 describes the classifier systems without genetics. Section 4 describes 
behavior in the stationary equilibria of Kiyotaki and Wright and also the types 
of classifier systems that could support that behavior. 
Section 5 defines 
stability criteria for sets of classifier systems, and discusses how these defini- 
tions can be used to formulate questions about whether systems of classifier 
systems converge to a stationary equilibrium. Section 6 describes classifier 
systems operating with genetics. Section 7 describes our simulations of systems 
of classifier systems. In addition to the economies studied by Kiyotaki and 
Wright (including one with fiat money), we study an economy with five types 
of agents and five goods. Section 8 concludes the paper. 
2. The Kiyotaki-Wright environment 
There are three types of agents, with types being indexed by i = 1,2,3. Type 
i agents get utility only from consuming type i good. Type i agent has access 
to a technology for producting type i* good, where i* f 
i. We initially specify 
‘When the state and action spaces are small, as in the Kiyotaki-Wright 
model, the list of all 
possible rules mapping states into actions is not too long. In such a situation, one can follow 
Axelrod (1986) and model an agent’s strategy as a single binary bit string. A pure genetic 
algorithm can then be applied, as in Axelrod (1986). This approach has been applied to the 
Kiyotaki-Wright 
model by Marimon and Miller (1989) and by Knez and Litterman (1989). While 
much easier to implement than classifier systems, this pure genetic approach also has some 
drawbacks. First, it is difhcult to extend to situations involving ‘unforeseen contingencies’ and in 
which it is not practical to enumerate all of the histories that might be encountered in the course 
of play. Second, relative to the classifier, the pure genetic algorithm encodes information 
wastefully in the sense that an entire strategy is encoded, while the experience of play will 
typically throw up observations only on a small subset of the possible states. While the classifier 
system concentrates ‘effort’ on learning rules to use in frequently encountered states, the pure 
genetic algorithm purports to be learning about entire strategies. Third, classifiers can learn 
general rules that apply to several states and that offer potential informational economies.

This specification 
assumes no ‘double 
coincidence 
of wants’ and seems to call 
for a multilateral 
trading 
arrangement. 
All goods are indivisible. 
Each agent 
can store one and only one unit of only one good from one period to the next. 
When an agent of type i consumes 
good i at time t, he immediately 
produces 
good i*, which he carries over to the next period. The net utility 
to an agent of 
type i of consuming 
good y and producing 
good i* is given by ui(y). 
We 
assume 
that an agent of type i does not know his utility 
function, 
but does 
recognize 
utility 
when he experiences 
it. The goods are costly to store. Storing 
good 
k (k = 1,2,3) 
from 
t to t + 1 imposes 
costs 
at t of sk. Following 
Kiyotaki 
and Wright, 
we assume that ss > sZ > si > 0. We summarize 
this cost 
function 
by saying that s(y) is the one-period 
cost of storing 
one unit of good 
y. We assume that individuals 
do not know this cost function, 
but that they do 
recognize 
costs when they bear them. 
The economy 
and each agent 
within 
it live forever. 
There 
are large and 
equal 
numbers 
of agents 
of each type. We modify 
Kiyotaki 
and 
Wright’s 
model 
by assuming 
that each agent cares about 
his long-run 
average 
level of 
utility. 
(Kiyotaki 
and Wright assumed 
that agents have preferences 
ordered 
by 
expected 
discounted 
future utilities.) 
Each period, 
there is a random 
matching 
process 
that assigns each and every agent in the economy 
to a pair with one 
and only one other agent in the economy. 
The random 
matching 
technology 
matches 
agents without 
regard to type. Only pairs of agents matched 
together 
can trade at a point in time. 
The economy 
begins at t = 0 with agents being endowed 
with an arbitrary 
and randomly 
generated 
initial distribution 
of holdings 
of goods. At each date 
t 2 0, each agent 
i has to make two decisions 
sequentially. 
First, 
given 
the 
good he is holding 
and given the good held by the partner 
with whom he is 
matched 
at t, he must decide whether to propose 
to trade. Trade occurs only if 
both parties propose 
to do so. Second, the agent must decide whether or not to 
consume 
the good 
with which 
he exits the trading 
process. 
If he doesn’t 
consume, 
he simply carries the good into period 
t + 1, experiencing 
cost sk. If 
an agent of type i does consume 
good y, at t, he experiences 
net utility 
u,(y,), 
produces 
good i*, and experiences 
carrying 
costs si.. We assume that ui( k) = 0 
if k f i and ui(i) = ui > 0. We follow Kiyotaki 
and Wright 
both in adopting 
their specification 
of the physical environment 
and in considering 
only Markov 
strategies, 
but we drop the assumption 
of rational 
agents. 
Instead, 
our agents 
are assumed 
to be ‘artifically 
intelligent’, 
in the sense that they use versions 
of 
the clussij%r system introduced 
by Holland 
(1986).

Before describing the classifier systems used by our agents, we introduce 
some notation for naming agents and for describing the state of each individ- 
ual agent in the economy. There is a collection of agents JS?= { 1,2,. . . , A}. A 
typical element of SS? is denoted a. Kiyotaki and Wright assumed that there 
was a continuum of each type of agent, while we assume that there is a finite 
number of each type. The first A, agents are of type I, the next A, are of type 
II, and the following A, are of type III. Here A = 34. 
At the beginning of time t, agent u is carrying good x,~. The variable x,( 
characterizes 
the pre-match state of agent a at time t. There is a random 
matching process which each period matches each agent a E SS? with a distinct 
agent p,(a) ES’. For each agent in each period, the matching process induces 
a function p,(a): I+&. 
After the matching process, the pre-trade state of 
agent a is (x,,, x,,(+). 
The pair (xot, x~,(~)~) = z,, records what agent a is 
carrying and what the agent p,(u) with whom u is matched at I is carrying. 
At r, after being matched with agent p,(u), agent a decides whether or not 
to propose to trade. We let X,, denote the trading decision of agent a at time 
t, where 
x,t= 
1 
if 
a proposes to trade xat for xp,(=),, 
0 
if 
a refuses to trade. 
(I) 
Similarly, &,(.), summarizes the trading decision of the agent p,(u) with 
whom a is patred at t. Trade takes place if and only if X,,. XP,(,,),= 1. 
Let xz, denote the post-trade (but pre-consuming 
decision) holdings of 
agent a at t. We then have that 
(2) 
After leaving the trading process with holdings x;I:, agent u must decide 
whether to consume xzt or to carry it into the next period. We let y,, denote 
the consumption decision of agent a at t where 
1 
Yet = 
if 
a decides to consume XL,, 
0 
if 
a decides not to consume. 
(3) 
If agent a decides to consume, he automatically produces good f(u), which he 
carries into (t + 1). From the specification of i* as a function of i described 
above for Kiyotaki and Wright’s model A, we have that f(u) is a good of type 
2 if a is a type I agent, f(u) is a good of type 3 if a is a type II agent, and 
f(u) is a good of type 1 if a is a type III agent. It follows that beginning-of-

3. Classifier systems for the Kiyotaki-Wright 
environment 
We now describe 
the classiJer systems that agents use to make their trading 
and consumption 
decisions.4 
Agents 
sequentially 
use two interconnected 
clas- 
sifier systems 
each period. A first trading 
classifier system receives input in the 
form of the pre-trade 
state z,~ = (x,,, xp,(=), ). This classifier system determines 
the trading 
decision 
A,,, which interacts 
with the trading 
decision 
hp,(a)f of 
the agent 
p,(a) 
with whom 
a is paired 
at t to determine 
x,: 
[see eq. 
(2)]. A second consumption 
classifier system takes x,: as input and determines 
the consumption 
decision 
ya,. The two classifier 
systems 
are used sequentially 
in this way each period, 
and their accounting 
systems 
are interconnected 
in 
ways to be described 
below. 
A 
(i) 
(ii) 
classifier system consists 
of the following 
objects: 
(iii) 
A collection 
of trinary 
strings, called ‘classifiers’. 
A system for interpreting 
or decoding 
the strings or classifiers 
as instruc- 
tions mapping 
states into decisions. 
The first part of a string encodes 
a 
particular 
state or condition, while the second 
part encodes 
a particular 
action. 
Thus, 
an individual 
classifier 
or string 
is just 
an encoding 
of a 
single (state, action) pair. For a given state, there can be many classifiers 
present 
in a classifier system.

attached 
to each classifier

‘A pure genetic 
algorithm 
could be applied 
to the trading 
decision 
as follows. 
For each agent, 
there are 3 x 3 = 9 possible 
values that his current 
state prior to trade can attain. 
There are two 
possible 
actions. 
trade or don’t trade. Letting 
1 mean trade and 0 mean don’t trade, a binary 
string 
of length 
9 can be used to encode 
a Markovian 
strategy. 
This is done by numbering 
the set of 
possible 
states .I = 1.. 
,9 and then letting the 1 th entry in the bit string denote the decision 
to be 
made when the ,jth state is encountered. 
The genetic algorithm 
is then applied 
to select the best 
binary 
string (i.e.. the best strategy).

systems. 
Because 
the optimization 
is done over entire 
strategies, 
which include 
descriptions 
of decisions 
to be made in o/l possible 
states, 
even rarely 
visited 
ones, 
the encoding 
of information 
is wasteful 
and does not 
facilitate 
more 
intensive 
learning 
about 
frequently

A system for reading in external messages or ‘states’ and for determining 
the set of classifiers that are pertinent, i.e., the set of classifiers whose 
‘conditions’ are satisfied or ‘matched’ at that state. For a given state, the 
system can sometimes contain several classifiers with distinct actions. 
An ‘auction system’ for determining which of the pertinent classifiers is 
allowed to make a decision at t. Among all classifiers whose condition 
part matches the actual state at t, the ‘highest bidder’ in the auction 
actually ‘makes the decision’ in real time.5 
An accounting system for updating the strengths of the collection of 
classifiers in response to the net rewards that flow into the system as a 
result of the decisions that are made. 
and possibly: 
(vii) A genetic algorithm for introducing new strings and extinguishing old 
strings. This algorithm will be called whenever states are encountered for 
which no existing classifiers have their conditions met. The algorithm 
may also be applied from time to time as a device to promote experimen- 
tation. 
We now describe each of these elements as applied to the Kiyotaki-Wright 
environment. We first consider an exchange classifier system, which maps the 
pre-trade state z,, into a trading decision. This classifier system consists of a 
list of trinary strings of length 7. The first three digits represent own storage, 
the next three represent trading partner’s storage, and the seventh represents 
the trading decision. Table 1 displays the encoding of the goods stored. The 
coding is written in the trinary alphabet (l,O, #), where # means ‘don’t care’. 
For the trading decision, the code is in the binary alphabet (l,O), where 1 
means trade, while 0 means don’t trade. To illustrate how the codes in table 1

to permit 
a ‘stochastic 
auction’ 
in which the probability 
of 
winning 
the auction 
varies directly with strength.

The 
first classifier 
instructs 
an agent 
who is carrying 
good 
1 and 
who is 
matched 
with someone 
carrying 
good 3 to offer to trade. The second classifier 
instructs 
an agent who is carrying 
good 1 not to trade if he is matched 
with 
someone 
who is not carrying 
good 3. 
The exchange 
classifier system of agent a consists 
of a list of such classifiers. 
Let e = 1,2,. . . , E, index this collection 
of classifiers. 
A given classifier 
system 
has a fixed number 
of classifiers. 
For the exchange 
classifier system, how many 
distinct 
classifiers 
are possible? 
Evidently, 
33 x 33 X 2 = 1458. However, 
most 
of these classifiers 
are redundant 
in the sense that only a subset 
of them is 
needed 
to represent 
all possible 
trading 
decision 
rules defined 
on the state 
space zUI = (x,,, 
xp,(+ ) when there are three goods. All rules can be written 
in 
terms 
of pairs 
of conditions 
drawn 
from table 
1. Thus, 
only 6 X 6 X 2 = 72 
strings 
are required 
to represent 
the complete 
set of possible 
rules 
for this 
system. 
Assigned 
to each exchange 
classifier e E { 1,2,. . . , E,} is a strength, denoted 
S,“(t). 
The 
strength 
S,“(t) 
evolves 
over time in a way determined 
by the 
accounting 
system. The strengths 
attached 
to classifiers 
are used to determine 
the decisions 
made by the classifier system at t. For a given state or ‘condition’ 
_ 
‘at = (X,V xp (a)t ), there is a collection 
of classifiers 
within 
the classifier 
system 
whose condiiions 
are satisfied. We denote the set of such classifiers 
by M,( za,), 
defined 
as 
w.(zar) = {e: zat matches the condition 
part of classifier 
e } . 
(5) 
The members 
of MJ z,,) form a class of potential 
‘bidders’ 
in an ‘auction’ 
whose purpose 
is to determine 
which classifier 
makes the decision 
of agent 
a 
at time t. When 
state z,, is encountered 
at time t by agent 
a, the classifier 
belonging 
to M,(z,,) 
that has the highest 
strength 
makes 
the decision. 
Let 
e,(z,,) 
denote 
the index 
of the classifier 
to be used in deciding 
whether 
to 
trade at t. Then, 
e,(z,,) 
=argmax{S,“(t): 
eEM,(z,()}. 
We denote 
the action (trade or no trade) taken by classifier 
e,(z,,) 
as X,,. Eqs. 
(5) and (6) describe 
the ‘auction 
system’ by which the highest 
strength 
rule 
that applies 
in a given state is given the right to decide for agent 
a at t.

Because the trade and consumption classifier systems will be making pay- 
ments to one another, we have to describe the consumption classifier system 
before describing the accounting system that updates strengths of the trade 
classifier system. The consumption classifier system is a collection of trinary 
strings of length 4. The first three positions encode xz, using the same code 
that was described in table 1. The condition part of the strings is written in 
terms of the trinary alphabet (O,l, a). The fourth position of a consumption 
string is the ‘action’ part, taking values of 1 (meaning consume) and 0 
(meaning don’t consume). 
We let consumption classifier strings be indexed by c E { 1,2, . . . , C, }. The 
strength assigned to classifier c of agent a is S,“(t). By virture of eq. (2), the 
state x,: can be expressed in terms of x,~ = (x~~,x~,(~),). Therefore it suffices 
to denote the set of ‘matched’ classifiers by Me(.rO,), where 
M,( z,,) = { c: XL, matches the condition part of classifier c} . 
(7) 
Let c,(z,,) denote the classifier that makes the consumption decision at t. 
The highest-strength classifier gets to make the decision: 
c,(z,,) 
=argmax{ 
S:(t): 
cEM,(z,,)}. 
(8) 
Given the decisions determined by (6) and (8), x,* evolves according to the 
law of motion (4). 
We attach to each exchange classifier e a ‘counter’ r,(t) which records the 
cumulative number of times that classifier e has won the auction as of date t. 
We shall change the strength of classifier e only when it actually wins the 
auction and thereby gets to make the exchange decision, which is why we need 
the counter 7,(t). The counter 7,(t) for classifier e is defined recursively in 
terms of the indicator I,“(t), which records whether classifier e wins the 
auction: 
1 if 
e wins the auction ( unless classifier 
I,“( 1) = 
e sets A,, = 1 while hp,(=), = 0, so that 
the offer to trade is not reciprocated), 
0 
otherwise,

Similarly, 
we attach 
to each consumption 
classifier 
c a ‘counter’

which

as 
The counters 
T,(r) and T,(r) induce a transformation 
of time in terms of which 
the strengths 
of classifiers 
c and e are updated. 
At date r, a strength

attached 
to classifier 
c, while a strength 
S$C1j is attached 
to classifier 
e of 
agent 
a. At date r, if classifier 
e’s condition’ 
is matched 
[i.e., if e E M=(z,~)], 
then classifier 
e makes a bid of b,(e)S,“(r), 
where b,(e) is a positive 
fraction 
that can depend 
on e. If classifier 
e wins the auction, 
its bid will be deducted 
from its strength. 
The winning 
bid will be allocated 
to augment 
the strength 
of 
other classifiers 
whose actions 
drove the system to the state that satisfied 
e’s 
condition. 
We choose the particular 
bid function 
where b,, and b,, are positive constants 
adding 
up to less than one, and ae is 
a fraction 
which is proportional 
to the specificity 
of a particular 
classifier. 
In 
particular, 
we choose 
ue = l/(1 
+ number 
of #‘s in the string). 
Similarly, 
we 
define a function 
b2(c) as 
b,(c) = b,, + b,,ac> 
(lib) 
where uC = l/(1 
+ number 
of #‘s in the string). 
By the above choices of b,(e) 
and b2( c), we favor specific rules over more general rules that can be activated 
by a particular 
state. When c E M,( z,~), classifier c makes a bid of b2( c)Sf( r). 
Only winning 
classifiers 
pay their bids by having 
them deducted 
from their 
strengths. 
The 
bid of the winning 
exchange 
classifier 
at r is paid 
to the 


=== PAGE 11 ===

R. Marimon, Money OS u medium of exchange 
339 
winning consumption 
classifier at I - 1, which is the classifier that is to be 
credited with setting the time t state to I,,. The bid of the winning consump- 
tion classifier at t is paid to the winning exchange classifier at time I, which is 
to be credited with setting the post-exchange state at t at x;I:, thereby giving 
the winning consumption classifier a chance to bid. 
We represent these payments in terms of the following difference equations: 
In (12), U,(y,4) is the external payoff when the winning consumption classifier 
c makes final consumption decision y,“,. If the post-exchange state at t is x,:, 
then we have 
V,(YZ> 
=YZ[“i(xO:) 
-S(f(a))l + (l-YZ)s(xit). 
(14) 
There are several features of (12) and (13) that bear emphasizing. First, eqs. 
(12) and (13) are recursive formulas that make S$oj 
and S&70j averages of 
past payoffs (external 
rewards plus bids received from other classifiers) 
minus payments (bids made to other classifiers). Use of cumulative average 
net payoffs in this way (as opposed to total payoffs) is a departure 
from 
the 
existing 
literature 
on 
classifiers. 
Second, 
notice 
how 
the 
term 
~,C(~)bl(4S~,~(~) 
expresses the condition that only the winning exchange 
classifier at t pays the winning consumption classifier at t - 1. Use of the term 
~,CV)b&)%:(,, 
achieves an analogous purpose in (13). Third, notice how 
the use of the counters r:(f) and $(t) 
causes changes to be made only to the 
strengths attached to the winning classifiers. 
Fig. 1 illustrates how the exchange and consumption 
classifier systems 
interact for an individual of type I. Suppose that the state at time t is encoded 
010 100. This means that the type I individual is storing good 2 and has been 
matched with someone who is storing good 1. The individual has two classi- 
fiers whose conditions are matched, one with strength 50, the other with 
strength 10. The strength 50 classifier makes the decision, which is ‘l’, namely, 
offer to trade. If the individual’s trading partner also offers to trade, the

individual exits the trading process with state 100, which is the input into type 
I’s consumption 
classifier. With this input, there are two consumption 
classi- 
fiers whose conditions are matched, one with strength 80 that says ‘consume’, 
the other with strength - 1 that says ‘don’t consume’. The individual con- 
sumes, initiating an external payoff. The bold lines indicate the flows of 
payoffs. 
In addition 
to the external payoff to the winning consumption 
classifier, there is a payment from the winning consumption classifier at t to 
the winning exchange classifier at t, and a payment from the winning ex- 
change classifier at t to the winning consumption classifier at t - 1. 
With (12), (13), and (14), we have completed our description of the classifier 
system for agent a when that classifier system contains a complete enumera- 
tion of possible rules. Our version of the Kiyotaki-Wright 
model is formed by 
assuming that each agent a of type i uses the same classifier system to make 
decisions.6 Thus, we can replace a superscripts and subscripts in the descrip- 
tions of strengths by i’s. We start with a set of initial strengths S’(0) for 
i = 1,2,3. We temporarily introduce the index T to index calendar time, while 
t now temporarily 
indexes the cumulative number of matches which have 
occurred rather than calendar time. Our artificially intelligent agents then 
interact as follows for each T = 1,2,. . . , L, where L is the length of our 
simulation. All A agents are randomly matched into A/2 pairs. For each pair 
(a, a’), the exchange and classifier systems for agents whose types are a and 
Q’, respectively, are used mutually to determine the trading and consumption 
decisions of agents a and u’. After the consumption decisions have been made 
for the pair, the counters and the strengths of the classifier systems for both 
types of agents are updated according to (lo), (ll), (12), and (13). Also, after 
each pair has played, the synthetic time counter t is augmented by one. After 
all A/2 pairs have played, the counter T is augmented by one, and the entire 
process is repeated. The counter T records the passage of physical time, while 
the counter t records the cumulative number of matches that have occurred. 
The outcomes of all matches t E [(T - 1X A/2) + 1, T( A/2)] are interpreted as 
having occurred during period T. 
In section 7, we shall be interested in recording various frequency distribu- 
tions across agents as a function of calendar time. That is, there will be 
distinct frequency distributions of, e.g., holdings of goods across agents for 
each date in calendar time. At the risk of confusion, we choose to index 
calendar time by t (rather than T) in subsequent sections. 
6We make this specification 
in order to economize 
on computer time and space. It is possible 
that this specification 
speeds convergence relative to a setting in which each agent a ESB uses his 
own classifier system. However, relative to a setup in which each agent uses his own classifier 
system and so can experiment individually, 
the common classifier setup causes all type i agents to 
experiment 
simultaneously. 
This feature might delay convergence.

4.1. The fundamental 
equilibrium 
For their model A, Kiyotaki 
and Wright 
define as the fundamental 
equilib- 
rium 
the trading 
pattern 
defined 
by the triangle 
depicted 
in fig 2. In this 
trading 
pattern, 
good 1, which has the lowest storage cost, serves as the general 
medium 
of exchange. 
In terms of storage, agents of type I only store good 2, 
which 
they exchange 
only for good 1; agents 
of type III only store good 1, 
which they exchange 
only for good 3; and agents of type II half of the time 
store good 1, which they exchange 
for good 2, and half of the time good 3, 
which they exchange 
for good 1. 
We can characterize 
equilibria 
in terms of a set of probabilities 
that describe 
holding 
and exchanging 
patterns. 
We define 
r;;(k) 
= probability 
that a type i agent is holding 
k 
at t. 
n,hW) 
= probability 
that a randomly 
selected 
agent is 
ri;(kj) 
= 
ri;( kjlk) = 
q;(k) 
= 
C(klk) 
= 
q(ilk) 
= 
holding 
k at t. 
probability 
that a type i agent exchanges 
k 
for j at t. 
probability 
that a type i agent exchanges 
k 
for j given that i is holding 
k at the 
beginning 
of t. 
probability 
that a type i agent consumes 
k 
at 1, 
(15) 
probability 
that a type i agent consumes 
k 
at t given that he holds k after trading 
at t, 
probability 
that an agent is of type i given 
that he holds k at t. 
We use the notation 
i;,T(kjlk) 
to denote 
the probability 
that a type i agent 
is 
willing 
to exchange 
good 
k for j whenever 
i is holding 
k. Note 
also that 
Tt(ilk) 
= vrii:(k)/fCi,ri!:(k), 
ri:(kj) 
= mi:(kjIk)?ri:(k), 
and 
rrh(k) 
= 
fc,~i~i:< k). 
We denote 
by 17, the entire set of probabilities 
defined in (15) for all i, k, j.

We now describe how the strategies that support Kiyotaki and Wright’s 
‘fundamental 
equilibrium’ can be represented as a classifier system. For the 
classifiers we introduce the following additional notation. Let e& j,d denote 
the exchange classifier for a type i agent that reads ‘If I am stormg good k 
and I meet an agent with good j, then my exchange decision is d ‘; d E (0, l}. 
Similarly, specific consumption classifiers for type i agents are of the form c:,~ 
for ‘If, at the end of the exchange subperiod, I am storing good k, then my 
consumption 
action is d ‘. For more general rules, we use the subindex -j to 
denote ‘not good j’ and # to denote ‘any good’. That is, ei,_i,a 
is the 
classifier for type I agents that reads ‘If I am storing good 2 and I meet an 
agent not carrying good 1, then do not trade’, and ci,e is a classifier for type I 
that reads ‘No matter what I am storing at the end of the exchange subperiod, 
do not consume’. 
We can simplify the study of classifiers systems by considering only a small 
complete set of rules. For type I agents these rules are: ei,,,,; 
eBz,,; e’,,,,,; 
4,s.r; 4, -I,o;

or 
alternatively 
{ei,,,,;

~‘_~,o} 
are the only classifiers being used 
by agents of type I, we can say that type I agents support the fundamental 
equilibrium. We can also describe classifiers for type II and type III agents

It is useful to define formally 
the sense in which these fixed lists of classifiers 
support 
Kiyotaki 
and Wright’s fundamental 
equilibrium. 
Let D, be a fixed set 
of classifiers 
(exchange 
and consumption 
classifiers) 
for agent a. Let the set D, 
have 
no redundancies 
in the sense 
that 
for every 
state 
z,,, 
D, 
uniquely 
determines 
actions. 
Then the fixed set of classifiers 
D, represents 
a strategy 
for 
agent 
a defined 
on z,,. We use the following 
definition 
of optimality 
for a 
fixed set of classifiers: 
Definition. 
Given 
the probability 
distributions 
II and fixed sets of classifiers 
of the other agents 
D,, for all a’ f a, a fixed set of classifiers 
D, is said to be 
optimal for agent a if there exists no other set fia which yields higher long-run 
average 
utility 
for agent u. 
A stationary 
Nash equilibrium 
can then be defined 
as follows: 
Definition. 
A stationary 
Nash equilibrium 
is a set of probability 
distributions 
II and fixed sets of classifiers 
D,, a = 1,. . , A, such that: 
(1) Given 
II and D,, for u’ # a, D, is optimal 
for agent 
a. 
(2) {D,,u= 
I,..., 
A } and the random 
matching 
technology 
imply that II, = II 
for all t. 
This definition 
is just an alternative 
representation 
of Kiyotaki 
and Wright’s 
definition 
in terms of fixed lists of classifiers. 
Table 
2 illustrates 
the sequence 
of events 
under 
the circumstance 
that the 
only active (i.e., auction-winning) 
classifiers 
are those that support 
the funda- 
mental 
equilibrium 
for agents 
of type I. A natural 
question 
is whether 
the 
classifier 
systems 
of the three 
types 
of agents 
will actually 
converge 
to a 
situation 
in which 
the fundamental 
equilibrium 
of Kiyotaki 
and 
Wright 
is supported. 
Before 
introducing 
some 
concepts 
that 
will 
help 
us think 
about 
this question, 
we shall briefly 
describe 
another 
kind 
of equilibrium 
of Kiyotaki 
and Wright’s 
model and the kind of classifier 
system 
that could 
support 
it.

above, is not the only possible one in equilibrium. They show that there can 
occur a speculative equilibrium with a trading pattern depicted in fig. 3.’ 
In the speculative equilibrium, table 3 depicts the flow of events in the 
stationary rational-expectations 
equilibrium for a classifier system of a type I 
agent using a subset of rules. Notice that the flows depicted in table 3 reduce 
to a set of fundamental classifiers if the dotted link (* ) replaces its alternative 
link (* * ), i.e., if type I agents decide not to trade good 2 for good 3. 
‘Kiyotaki and Wright establish a condition under which the unique stationary rational-expecta- 
tions equilibrium is a fundamental equilibria. The condition, for the limiting case as the discount 
rate converges to zero, is that the following inequality is satisfied: 
Ss-S*> 
($(3) 
-&2))$11. 
(16) 
[Notice that this condition involves both parameter 
values (ss,ss, ur) and the quantities 
(r{(3), n:(2)) which are endogenous variables that are determined in equilibrium.] Kiyotaki and 
Wright show that when the above inequality is reversed, then the unique stationary rational- 
expectations equilibrium is a speculative equilibrium. Vis-Bvis the fundamental equilibrium, the 
only change in trading patterns is that agents of type I ‘speculate’ by holding good 3, which is not 
too costly because in equilibrium inequality (16) is reversed (see fig. 3.) 


=== PAGE 18 ===

In section 
7 we shall provide 
an example 
of a simulated 
classifier 
economy 
where (16) is not satisfied (ut is too high), but where nevertheless 
when agents 
start 
with 
a complete 
set of classifiers 
(with 
homogeneous 
strengths), 
the 
classifier 
systems 
converge 
to the fundamental 
equilibrium 
and 
not to the 
speculative 
equilibrium. 
Before turning 
to these simulations, 
we define 
some 
notions 
of stability 
that are designed 
to distinguish 
alternative 
senses in which 
a set of classifier 
systems may be said to converge. 
5. Concepts of convergence for classifier systems playing games 
Given 
the decision 
rules being 
employed 
by other 
agents, 
(12)-(13) 
for 
agent 
a forms 
a system 
of stochastic 
difference 
equations 
in the strengths 
s”(t). 
Since the classifier 
systems 
of the three types of agents 
i = 1,2,3 
are 
operating 
simultaneously, 
the behavior 
of the entire 
system 
is determined 
by 
the system 
of difference 
equations 
(12)-(13) 
for agent 
types 
i = 1,2,3. 
Let 
s’(t) 
denote 
the strengths 
for an agent 
of type 
i. It is natural 
to inquire 
whether 
the system 
formed 
by (12)-(13) 
for a = i = 1,2,3 
converges 
to a 
stationary 
point 
in the space of strengths, 
and if it does so, whether 
that 
stationary 
point supports 
the fundamental 
equilibrium 
of Kiyotaki 
and Wright. 
Although 
we have not yet carried out an analysis 
of the convergence 
of this 
system, 
it seems useful at this point 
to report 
our ideas about 
how such an 
analysis 
could be structured. 
In this section 
we indicate 
how ideas from the 
stochastic-approximation 
literature 
might be used to study convergence 
in the 
space of strengths.8 
From 
the stochastic-approximation 
literature,’ 
we know 
that 
any 
limit 
points 
(Sf, S:) of (12)-(13) 
must satisfy 
(17) 
(1 +b,(e))S,“- 
~I,“(t)b2(c)S~ 
=O, 
C’ 
1 
for all c and 
e. For a given 
a we define the solutions 
(S,“, Sz) of (17) as a 
stationary 
set of strengths 
for agent 
a. Given 
a stationary 
set of strengths 
for 
agent 
a, one can determine 
the set of classifiers 
{e, c} = W~(zar) that would 
‘It was considerations 
from the stochastic-approximation 
literature 
that let us to alter Holland’s 
specification 
of the laws of motion of strengths 
so that they measure 
cumulative 
uoerclge past net 
rewards, 
not total rewards. 
The use of average rewards 
makes it possible 
for strengths 
to converge. 
Arthur 
(1989) uses average 
rewards 
for strengths 
for the same reason. 
‘Llung 
and Soderstrom 
(1983) is a useful reference 
on stochastic 
approximation 
and on the 
‘ordinary 
differential-equations 
approach’ 
to proving 
almost 
sure convergence. 
See Marcet 
and 
Sargent 
(1989a. b) for some applications 
in economics.

win the auction for each z,,. If a has the fixed set of classifiers Wa(zar) = D,, 
where D, is the fixed set of classifiers that supports a’s behavior in a Nash 
equilibrium, then the stationary set of strengths associated with W,( z,,) can be 
said to support the stationary Nash equilibrium behavior of agent a. 
These definitions inspire several questions. First, given stationary sets of 
strengths for agents of types 1,2,3, is it true that W,( z,,) = D, for a type i 
agent, for each i = 1,2,3? That is, does a stationary set of strengths for the 
classifier systems for agents of type i = 1,2,3 support a stationary 
Nash 
equilibrium? 
Second, given fixed sets of classifiers D, for a of type i = 1,2,3 that support 
a stationary Nash equilibrium, do these sets of classifiers imply the existence 
of a set of strengths S, for a of type i = 1,2,3 that solve (17)? That is, is every 
Nash equilibrium supported as a stationary point in strengths? 
Third, if we let the classifier systems of agents of type i = 1,2,3 run in real 
time, does the joint system formed by (12)-(13) 
for agents of each type 
converge almost surely, and if so, to which solution of (17) does it converge? 
We know from the theory of stochastic approximation 
that if it converges, it 
must converge to solutions of (17). 
Associated with the third of these questions is the notion of global asymp- 
totic stability. In future work, we plan to apply results from the stochastic 
approximation 
literature to study the global asymptotic stability of versions of 
our interacting classifier systems. 
We also intend to study a form of stability that is distinct from and weaker 
than global asymptotic stability. This form of stability is summarized in the 
following: 
Nash-like stability test. Take a stationary equilibrium fixed by II. Place a 
single-agent 
of a given type i in the environment 
formed by the fixed 
probabilities 
II. Let a classifier system for that single agent operate until it 
converges. Check to see whether it converges to imply the collection 
of 
classifiers D, for an agent a of type i which are required to support the 
equilibrium probabilities. In this experiment, in running the classifier system 
for the single agent, the decision rules of all other agents of his type are being 
held fixed at their equilibrium values. This experiment is to be repeated for a 
single agent of each type. 
In the remainder of this paper, we shall not pursue the formal analysis of 
the stability and convergence questions formulated above.” Instead, we shall 
report computer simulations. In these computer simulations, convergence can 
‘“Brian Arthur and Carl Simon have used stochastic approximation 
arguments to establish 
convergence of strengths for a fixed system of two classifiers playing a two-armed bandit. Their 
arguments do not apply to our system because their system is one in which there are competing 
classifiers with distinct actions, whose condition parts are identical and are always met.

R. Mcrrimon, Monqv as a medium of exchange 
be based either on the limiting 
behavior 
of the strengths, 
as indicated 
above, 
or on the convergence 
of key aspects of the empirical 
frequency 
distribution 
of 
holdings 
II,, which we defined in section 4. 
6. Incomplete enumeration classifiers and the ‘genetic algorithm’ 
We now describe 
how the classifier 
system is modified 
when we deal with 
systems 
in which 
there is not a complete 
enumeration 
of rules. In order 
to 
complete 
the system, 
two aspects must be added 
to the above description 
of 
the classifier 
system 
under 
complete 
enumeration. 
The 
first is a way 
of 
generating 
an initial 
population 
of rules. The second is a way of deleting 
old 
rules from the system 
and adding 
new rules to the system. 
To generate 
the 
initial 
population 
of rules, 
we simply 
use a random 
number 
generator 
to 
generate 
bit strings by choosing 
successive 
bits independently. 
The process 
of adding 
new rules and deleting 
old ones is accomplished 
by 
adding 
four major 
operations 
to the previous 
description 
of the workings 
of 
the classifier 
system. We call these steps ‘creation’, 
‘diversification’, 
‘specializa- 
tion’, 
and 
‘generalization’, 
respectively. 
The 
creation operation 
is activated 
when 
there 
is no classifier 
matching 
the current 
state 
z,~, i.e., 
M,(z,~) 
is 
empty. 
In this case, a new classifier 
is created 
with its condition 
part defined 
by the current 
state and its action part randomly 
selected. 
A ‘weak’ classifier 
from 
the set of all classifiers 
is deleted 
to keep the number 
of classifiers 
constant. 
The diversijication operation 
is designed 
to inject sufficient 
diversity 
into the range of actions 
called for by different 
classifiers 
in a given situation. 
For the exchange 
classifier, 
this step occurs at the stage at which z,~ has been 
observed 
and the set M,( z,,) has been constructed. 
Recall that M,( z,,) is the 
set of exchange 
classifiers 
whose condition 
parts match 
z,~. If all e E MJz,*) 
have the same action (0 or l), the diversification 
operation 
creates 
a classifier 
encoding 
the specific state z,( and an action 
opposite 
to that taken 
by the 
other classifiers 
in M,( z,~). The strength 
of the winning 
classifier is assigned 
to 
this new classifier. 
This new classifier is added to the system, while simultane- 
ously a ‘weak’ classifier 
from the set Me(zar) is deleted 
from the system. 
The 
weakness 
of a classifier is measured 
in terms of a combination 
of strength 
and 
cumulated 
number 
of times the classifier has won the bidding 
in the past. The 
diversification 
operation 
is used each time the classifier 
system is called upon. 
Notice 
that if this step were to be added to a complete 
enumeration 
system, it 
would have no effect on the population 
of rules because 
sufficient 
diversity 
is 
present 
from the beginning. 
The specialization operation 
is called 
randomly 
with a probability 
that we choose to be diminishing 
over time. The random 
variable 
governing 
specialization 
calls 
this step into 
action 
just 
after 
the 
winning 
bid has been determined. 
The winning 
classifier 
is checked 
to deter- 
mine 
whether 
there 
are any 
#‘s 
in its condition 
part. 
A new classifier 
is 
synthesized 
by exposing 
each # in the condition 
part to a probability 
of being

Fig. 4. The mating process for exchange 
classifiers who have drawn ‘3.6’ and ‘in’ 
switched to a 0 or a 1, whichever one specifically encodes the particular z,~ 
that was just observed or matched. This new and (probably) more specific rule 
is then used to replace a weak rule from the set e E M,( z,~) [or c E M,( z,,) in 
the case of the consumption 
classifier], where weakness is measured by a 
combination 
of strengths and cumulative number of times the auction has 
been won. 
The fourth step, which we call generalization 
is a version of a ‘genetic 
algorithm’. This step is called randomly, according to a probability 
that we 
specify to be declining through time. At a point when the step is called, the 
process is initiated 
by generating two distinct populations 
of classifiers: 
‘potential 
parents’ and ‘potential exterminants’. The potential parents are 
chosen to be a population of classifiers of specified size. They are chosen 
according to a ‘fitness criterion’ that weights strength and cumulative number 
of times that the classifier won the auction. The potential exterminants 
are 
chosen to be a population of specified size, whose members are of low fitness 
as measured by a fitness criterion weighting strengths and cumulative victories 
in past bidding. 
From the population of potential parents, a specified number of pairs of 
parents are randomly drawn to engage in ‘mating’ for the purpose of creating 
children. How a pair of parents mates can be illustrated for two exchange 
classifiers, which are bit strings of length 7, is depicted in fig. 4. 
The pair mates in two steps. First the pair draws two random integers 
uniformly distributed on [l, 71. The two integers signify the positions between 
bits depicted in fig. 4. In fig. 4, we have drawn lines in between bit positions 2 
and 3 and between positions 5 and 6 to signify that this couple has drawn a 3 
and 6. Next, a Bernoulli random variable with probability 
0.5 is drawn, 
assuming values of ‘in’ or ‘out’. If ‘in’ is drawn, we focus on the bits between 
the two lines, i.e., the bits inside the randomly drawn interval. (In fig. 4, we 
have drawn an ‘in’.) If ‘out’ is drawn, we focus on the bits outside 
the 
randomly drawn interval. Within the interval of focus, we complete the mating 
process 
via the following 
version 
of genetic 
crossover. 
For 
each of 
the parent strings in the area of focus, we change to a # any bits for which the 
parent strings disagree. (Here, # agrees with either 0 or 1, while 0 disagrees 
with 1). This process produces two children. The children are each assigned 
strengths that are the average of their parents’ strengths. The children are

This completes 
our description 
of the algorithm 
to be used for updating 
the 
classifier 
system 
when 
we deal 
with 
an incomplete 
enumeration 
classifier 
system. 
In the simulations 
to be reported 
in section 
7, we shall employ 
both 
complete 
and incomplete 
enumeration 
classifier 
systems. 
7. Simulation results 
The sets of parameters 
defining 
the economies 
under 
study are summarized 
in table 
4. The last column 
reports 
whether 
the Nash-Markov 
stationary 
equilibrium 
of Kiyotaki 
and Wright 
is speculative 
or fundamental 
for our 
parameter 
settings. 
Our 
economies 
differ 
from 
one 
another 
in parameter 
settings, 
and whether initial classifier systems contain 
a complete 
enumeration 
of states and actions 
or whether 
they are randomly 
generated, 
in which case 
the genetic 
algorithm 
described 
in section 6 is active. For all the simulations, 
we keep the number 
of exchange 
classifiers 
fixed at 72 for each type of agent, 
and the number 
of consumption 
classifiers 
fixed at 12 for each type of agent. 
We now briefly discuss the results. 
Economy AI 
Table 5 reports 
various probabilities 
that characterize 
the stationary

Al. 
These

the 
empirical 
frequencies 
from our simulations,

that a type i agent trades good j for good k, given that i is

of probabilities, it means that any probability in the interval is in equilibrium 
value. When a question mark appears behind a list of probabilities, it denotes 
that the event being conditioned upon has zero probability 
in equilibrium. 
Given the way that classifier systems learn from experience, it is too much to 
expect a classifier’s system to learn the correct sequential equilibrium behavior 
for zero probability events. 
Table 6 and fig. 5 report the results of a long simulation of Economy Al.1 
(Economy Al with complete enumeration of classifiers). In table 6, and in all 
subsequent tables of empirical frequencies, the frequencies reported are ten- 
period moving averages ending at the indicated time periods.ll 
The tables

simulation that no reliable frequency can be computed.

exchange, he eats it; for both the first and second classifier in the list have 
their conditions matched (‘good 1’ and ‘not good 3’) but the first has higher 
strength and therefore determines the decisions. When the agent is storing 2, 
he does not eat (the second and third classifiers have their conditions matched, 
but the second has higher strength). When the agent is storing 3, he eats (the 
third classifier is the only pertinent one). This last decision is wrong, but the

Economy Al.2 is identical to Economy Al.l, except that we use a randomly 
generated list of rules initially, and rely on a genetic algorithm to inject new 
rules into the classifier’s system. Economy Al.2 thus provides our first test for 
the genetic algorithm of section 6. i2 It is important to notice that while the size

of the exchange and consumption classifier systems is 72 and 12, respectively, 
the set of possible classifiers is 36 X 2 = 1458 and 33 x 2 = 54, respectively. At 
any one time, only a small subset of possible classifiers is in the system. The 
results for Economy Al.2 are summarized in table 7 and fig. 6. 
As we can see from fig. 6 and table 7, the distribution of holdings for agents 
of type I and III rapidly converge to their equilibrium levels. Type II agents 
only hold goods 1 and 3 as predicted but it takes longer to converge to the 
equilibrium values. The exchange decisions are the correct ones (even in period 
lOOO), except for a couple of events of very small probability (type I agents 
trade good 2 for 3 and type III agents trade good 1 for 2). 
Consumption decisions are basically correct, except that II consumes 3 and 
III consumes 1. Overeating has been a minor problem in several of our 
economies. In most such cases that we have encountered, such wrong behavior 
has been associated with low-frequency states for which it is difficult for the 
classifier system to acquire the experience required to reward better classifiers 
and ‘right’ actions. In our economies there are no production costs, and it is 
difficult for classifiers with low-frequency states to gain the adequate strength. 
In summary, both with complete enumeration and without it, our simula- 
tions of Economy Al seem to be converging to the stationary equilibrium, 
although this convergence is lower when initial classifiers are randomly gener- 
ated and new classifiers are synthesized. 
Economy A2 
Economy A2 differs from Economy Al only in that agents receive 500 utils 
from consuming 
their desired good instead of 100. With this change of 
parameters, for high enough discount factors the unique stationary equilibrium 
of Kiyotaki and Wright’s economy is the so-called speculative equilibrium 
previously described. The probabilities that characterize the speculative equi- 
librium 
are summarized 
in table 8. Our simulation 
is summarized 
in 
table 9. 
Table 9 depicts a pattern of holdings characteristic 
of a fundamental 
equilibrium, 
not a speculative one. Compare tables 9b and 9c with the 
theoretical predictions of tables 8b-8c and tables 5b-5c. Recall that a crucial 
difference between a speculative and a fundamental equilibrium is that in the 
former, type I agents are willing to exchange good 2 for good 3, while in the 
latter they are not. Table 9d shows that type I agents are willing to exchange 
good 2 for 3. That is, 7iic(jk12) = (l,O, 1) for i = I. This is to be compared with 
the situation for economy Al, in which I;:( jk12) = (l,O, 0) (see table 5d or 6d). 
Then how is it that the distribution of holding patterns fails to support a 
speculative 
equilibrium? 
The answer is to be found in the consumption 
classifiers of type I agents, which are too general (have too many # signs) to

distinguish 
among

the speculative 
equilibrium, 
it is 
necessary 
that 
the winning 
consumption 
classifiers 
be specific 
enough 
to 
permit 
distinguishing 
sufficiently 
among 
the goods stored so that the exchange 
classifiers 
can be properly 
compensated. 
It happens 
that the winning 
classifiers 
embody 
levels of generality 
that result in overconsumption 
of good 3 and a 
failure 
to transmit 
the information 
from 
the consumption 
classifier 
to the 
exchange 
classifier 
that would 
be required 
to support 
a speculative 
equilib- 
rium. 
We shall only briefly summarize 
the results for Economy 
A2.2 with random 
generation 
of initial 
classifiers, 
and refer the reader to our working 
paper 
for 
tables giving the numerical 
results. After 1000 iterations 
the economy 
had not 
converged 
to a steady state. Trading 
patterns 
were closer to the fundamental 
equilibria 
than to the speculative 
equilibrium 
in period 1000. (The reverse was 
true 
in period 
500.) However, 
the classifier 
system 
of Type 
I agents 
did 
distinguish 
between 
storage of different 
good for consumption, 
and the classi- 
fier ci,e was slowly gaining 
strength 
over time. Nevertheless, 
our simulations 
provided 
no support 
for a hope 
that the economy 
would 
converge 
to the 
speculative 
equilibrium 
if it were to last longer. 
While the results for Economy 
A2 are fairly inconclusive, 
they illustrate 
two 
interesting 
points. 
First, they expose some deficiencies 
of the genetic algorithm 
13To conserve 
space, 
these classifiers 
are not reported

which we have used (we return to this in section 8). Second, they raise the issue 
of whether our artificially intelligent agents are too impatient. 
Patience requires experience. 
The transfer system inside the classifier system 
is designed to converge to a set of long-run average strengths. In the limit, the 
artificially intelligent agents should behave as long-run average payoff maxi- 
mizers, since the steady-state strengths weight payoffs by their relative fre- 
quencies. It takes time, however, for optimal rules to achieve the desired 
strengths. The behavior of our artificially intelligent agents can be very myopic 
at the beginning. In economies, such as Economy A2, in which the nature of

rate, this early myopia 
might have a 
perverse 
effect in diverting 
the economy 
towards 
a low discount-factor 
station- 
ary equilibrium, 
such as the fundamental 
equilibrium.14 
The underlying 
algo- 
rithm has to provide 
enough experimentation 
to avoid an early ‘lock in’.15 The

algorithm 
seems defective 
in that it has too little experimentation 
to 
support 
the speculative

even in the long simulations 
we have run. 
Economy B 
Stability 
tests based on classifier 
systems 
are potentially 
useful as selection 
criteria 
in economies 
with multiple 
equilibria. 
While Economy 
A has a unique 
equilibrium, 
Economy 
B has two equilibria 
if the discount 
factor 
is not too 
low. 
Economy 
B has a different 
production 
pattern 
than Economy 
A (I produces 
3, II produces 
1, and III produces 
2). For the specified parameters 
(see table 4) 
two stationary 
equilibria 
are possible 
whose trading 
patterns 
are described 
by 
fig. 7. In the fundamental 
equilibrium, 
goods 
1 and 
2 serve as media 
of 
exchange, 
while in the speculative 
equilibrium 
goods 2 and 3 are the media of 
exchange 
[see Kiyotaki 
and Wright 
(1989)]. Tables 
10 and 11 summarize 
the 
trading 
patterns 
for the fundamental 
and the speculative 
equilibrium, 
respec- 
tively.

equilibrium 
exists for Economy 
A2 only if the discount 
factor 
is sufficiently

R. Munmon, Money us u medium of exchunge 
We simulated 
Economy 
B. Table 
12 summarizes 
the results 
for Economy 
B.l with complete 
enumeration 
of rules. Table 
13 summarizes 
the results 
for 
Economy 
B.2 with random 
initial 
classifiers. 
Economy 
B.l displays 
an interesting 
pattern 
of evolution. 
At iteration 
500 
the distribution 
of holdings 
and, especially, 
the trading 
patterns 
correspond 
to 
the speculative 
equilibrium 
(except in some very low probability 
events, as II’s 
unwillingness 
to trade good 1 for good 2). However, 
the economy 
moves away 
from this state and by iteration 
1000 has practically 
converged 
to the funda- 
mental 
equilibrium 
(with the same exception 
now of reverse sign but still of 
low probability). 
Economy 
B.2 with random 
initial 
classifiers 
had not converged 
after 2000 
periods. 
Nevertheless, 
as can be seen from table 13. the economy 
seems to be 
moving 
towards 
the fundamental 
equilibrium. 
In particular, 
with the exception 
of a zero-frequency 
event (II is willing 
to trade 1 for 3) the trading 
patterns 
correspond 
to the fundamental 
equilibrium. 
These 
two simulations 
for Economy 
B provide 
examples 
in which 
the 
classifier 
systems 
seem to select the fundamental 
equilibrium 
over the specula- 
tive equilibrium. 
l6 Furthermore, 
the results for Economy 
B.l indicate 
that this 
is not been the result of myopic behavior. 
Economy C 
In Economy 
C a new good, good 0, with the characteristics 
of ‘fiat money’ is 
introduced. 
No agent derives 
utility 
from consuming 
good 0. There 
are no 
storage 
costs associated 
with good C, although 
storing 
it uses up the storage 
capacity 
of each agent. 
Fiat money 
is introduced 
into the system by forcing 
some agents 
to store 
good 0 in period 0. In particular, 
48 units of good 0 are randomly 
allocated 
to 
48 agents. 
To avoid 
fluctuations 
in the quantity 
of money, 
agents 
are not 
allowed 
to consume 
good 0. A modified 
setup, not pursued 
here, would 
give 
agents 
the opportunity 
to learn not to eat money. 
The production 
technologies 
are as in Economy 
A (see table 4). Table 
14 
provides 
the probabilities 
that characterize 
the unique 
(fundamental) 
equilib- 
rium of Economy 
C. The equilibrium 
trading 
patterns 
are depicted 
in fig. 8. 
Table 
15 describes 
the results 
for Economy 
C with random 
generation 
of 
initial 
classifiers. 
The exchange 
classifier systems have 150 classifiers, 
while the 
population 
of possible 
classifiers 
has 13,122 strings. 
The economy 
converges 
remarkably 
fast to the fundamental 
equilibrium 
and, with minor 
fluctuations, 
the distribution 
of holdings 
remains 
stationary. 
The final exchange 
actions 
are 
161n Marimon 
and 
Miller (1989) 30 out of 30 experiments 
resulted 
in convergence 
to the 
fundamental 
equilibrium.

of 0.002 in the last ten periods (agents of type II give up good 1 for good 3, 
and agents of type III do not accept good 0 for good 1; see tables 15d and 
1%). 
Given the complexity of the exchange patterns with fiat money, the results 
for Economy C indicate the ability of our artificially intelligent agents to set 
up complex social arrangements like fiat money.” 
“A version of Economy C with the storage costs of Economy A did not converge. probably 
because the low cost of storing good 1 (0.1) made this good too good a substitute for fiat money. 
These results for Economy C have been successfully replicated in Marimon and Miller (1989).

Fig. 9. Production patterns in Economy D; an arrow shows that the agent at the origin of the 
arrow produces the good at the point of the arrow. 
Economy D 
In Economy D we enhance complexity by considering five goods and five 
types. The production 
technologies are described by fig. 9. That is, type I 
produces good 3, and so on. As before, each type of agent only derives utility 
from consuming the good of the same number. Storage costs are ranked in 
increasing order (see table 4). For this economy we do not start with any 
characterization 
of a stationary equilibrium. With enough work, one could 
obtain an analytic solution for the fundamental equilibrium for such economy, 
but here our purpose is to let our artificially intelligent agents suggest to us 
what an equilibrium might be. Given this suggestion, we could then presum- 
ably verify whether it is an equilibrium. Our simulation is reported in table 16. 
From the results in table 16, we can see that the trading patterns nearly 
seem to describe a fundamental equilibrium in which agents are only willing to 
trade for commodities of lower cost than the one currently in storage, except 
that they always accept the commodity 
of their type. These fundamental 
trading patterns are shown in fig. 10. Some speculative moves can be detected. 
An example of this is that agents of type II accept (from I) good 3 for good 1 
in order to trade 3 for 2 with type III. We do not pursue here a full analysis of 
partially speculative equilibria for this economy. 
8. Conclusions 
The work described above is presented as the first steps of our project to use 
the classifier systems of Holland to model learning in multi-agent environ- 
ments. Classifier systems have previously been applied to solve some complex 
optimization 
problems [see Machine Learning (1988)]. Our application 
has 
involved 
some extensions to handle the fact that ours is a multi-agent 
environment 
in which agents are solving Markovian dynamic decision prob- 
lems. 
The work described in this paper has accomplished two objectives that are 
parts of our broader project. First, our simulations have demonstrated 
by

R. Mrrrimon, Monqv us a medrum of exchange 
Fig. 10. Exchange 
patterns

D. exhibited 
by classifier systems 
example 
that multi-agent 
systems 
of classifiers 
can exhibit 
interesting 
behav- 
ior, and can eventually 
learn 
to play Nash-Markov 
equilibria. 
Second, 
the 
process 
of making 
classifier 
systems 
cope with the Kiyotaki-Wright 
environ- 
ment has prompted 
us to formalize 
a variety 
of concepts 
and definitions 
that 
our subsequent 
work shall build 
on. These 
definitions 
will facilitate 
formal 
analyses 
of systems 
of multi-agent 
classifier 
systems, 
which 
we intend 
to 
pursue. 
Among 
the 
unfinished 
aspects 
which 
we leave 
for 
future 
papers, 
two 
interrelated 
ones are quite important. 
First, our experiments 
with the genetic- 
type algorithms 
in our incomplete-enumeration 
classifier 
systems 
have con- 
vinced 
us that 
existing 
algorithms 
can be improved. 
These 
improvements, 
which will increase 
the amount 
of experimentation 
that is done at the ‘right 
times’, will have the effect of improving 
the capacity 
of the classifier systems to 
settle upon optimal 
outcomes 
more rapidly, 
and to avoid becoming 
locked in 
to suboptimal 
patterns 
of interaction. 
The improved 
algorithms 
will also help 
with a second 
major piece of unfinished 
business, 
which is to develop 
analyti- 
cal results on the convergence 
of classifier systems. The new algorithms 
will be 
set up in such a way that we can apply the stochastic 
approximation 
approach 
to convergence 
analysis 
which we alluded 
to in section 
5.
